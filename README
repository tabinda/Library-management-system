1.  Introduction
Many library systems are operated manually by group of people. In such situations many people involved in the process of managing the library such a way that to keep records regarding the books & students (borrowers), check the books manually, keep records on issued books etc. all these things have to be carried out manually & if the library is large in content handling is also a problem. 
On the other hand keeping large amount of maintenance workers may cost a lot & it will not be efficient for a library. Manual record keeping is also not a reliable method as people tend to forget things. On the borrower’s point of view, in manual system borrower can’t find a book exactly at once as they are not ordered well. Sometimes user might be searching for a book that is not available in the library in such situations people get annoyed or depressed. Therefore there should be a reliable way to manage the library system.
